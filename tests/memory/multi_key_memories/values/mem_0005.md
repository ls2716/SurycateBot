Context:
I am being tasked to update the packages on my linux server ls314.com. I have successfully sshed into the server and send the command to update the packages. I have been prompted for a password and I have sent it. I have to wait for the response.
Action Thought:
I can just wait for the response and use the get_output command to see the output.
Action:
get_output
Observation:
[sudo] password for lukasz: 
Sorry, try again

Observation Thought:
I got the output now and it looks like the password is incorrect.

I have been prompted for a password and I have sent it but it is not correct. I have to report back and ask what the correct password to the server is.
