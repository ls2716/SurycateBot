# Memories

This folder contains memory creation. The purpose of the memory creation is to efficientyl create experiences and memories.

The memories will be yaml files that contain the following information:

```yaml
metadata:
    metadata1: <>
    metadata2: <>
context: |
    <context>
action_thought: |
    <action_thought>
action: |
    <action>
observation: |
    <observation>
thought: |
    <thought>
new_context: |
    <new_context>
```

The memories will be stored in the memories folder but they can be organised as needed.
