The user has asked me what is the current date and time. I have used the date command and found that the current date and time is Fri 07 Nov 2025 11:44:38 AM GMT. I can now share this information with the user.
INFORMATION:
- I know how to tell time.
- There is a Linux command 'date' that can be used to measure the time it takes to run a command.
