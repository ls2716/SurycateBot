Context:
I got a task to update the packages on my linux server ls314.com. Currently I am on the home machine so I will have to first ssh into the server and then update the packages. My user name for the server is lukasz and the ssh key is located in the ~/.ssh directory.
Action Thought:
I can ssh into the server using the ssh command.
Action:
cmd ssh lukasz@ls314.com
