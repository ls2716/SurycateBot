Context:
I just started a project to create my personal website. I have created a folder named "WebsitePersonal". I want to create a markdown file with the description of the website but I am now in the parent folder of the "WebsitePersonal" folder. I need to change the directory to the "WebsitePersonal" folder.
Action:
cmd cd WebsitePersonal
Observation:
lukasz@Smith:~/Projects$ cd WebsitePersonal
lukasz@Smith:~/Projects/WebsitePersonal$
Thought:
I have changed the directory to the "WebsitePersonal" folder. I can now create the markdown file.
New Context:
I am working on a project to create a website. I am in the "WebsitePersonal" folder. I want to create a markdown file with the description of the website. To do that, I have to create a markdown file in the "WebsitePersonal" folder called README.md.
