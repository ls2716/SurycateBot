Context:
I am doing day to day tasks. I was just asked by the user for the current time. I have found out that the current time is 23 August 2024 15:04:34. I can now tell the user the current time.
Action:
cmd echo "Current time is 23 August 2024 15:04:34." > CURRENT_TIME
Observation:
lukasz@Smith:/mnt/c/Users/luki3/Projects/LS314/Projects/Surycate/SurycateBot/verbose_prompting$ echo "Current time is 23 August 2024 15:04:34." > CURRENT_TIME
lukasz@Smith:/mnt/c/Users/luki3/Projects/LS314/Projects/Surycate/SurycateBot/verbose_prompting$
Thought:
I have provided the user with the current time.
