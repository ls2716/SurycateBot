Context:
I am working on a project to create a website. I have just created a REAMDME.md file in the "WebsitePersonal" folder. I want to write the description of the website in the README.md file. I am currently in the "WebsitePersonal" folder which also contains the REAMDME.md file.
Action:
cmd echo "# Lukasz's personal website" > README.md
Observation:
lukasz@Smith:~/Projects/WebsitePersonal$ echo "# Lukasz's personal website" > README.md
lukasz@Smith:~/Projects/WebsitePersonal$
Thought:
I have written the description of the website in the README.md file. I can now start writing the content of the website in the README.md file.

The content of the website should include the different sections of the website such as the home page, about page, contact page, and other relevant information.
