My task now is to update the linux packages on my server. I have successfully connected to the server. I can now update the packages on the server. I have to run the command "apt list --upgradable" to see the list of packages that can be updated. I can then run the command "sudo apt upgrade" to update the packages.

----------------

Context:
I have to update the packages on my Linux machine. I am logged into the server at ls314.com using my username lukasz with key authentication. I have run the command to view the packages available for upgrade, and there are several packages, including important security updates. I have initiated the upgrade process by running "sudo apt upgrade -y." The command is currently asking for my password to proceed, indicating that my sudo configuration requires a password for administrative actions, despite my key authentication. I will enter
Action: cmd sudo apt upgrade -y  
Observation:
[sudo] password for lukasz:

Thought:
I need to provide my password to continue with the upgrade process, as the command requires administrative privileges. However, since I'm using key authentication, I shouldn't need to enter a password. This might indicate that my sudo configuration requires a password for this action.
