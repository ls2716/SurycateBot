Context:
I am working on a project to create a website. I have to create a folder for the project in the Projects directory. I want to create a folder named "WebsitePersonal" but I am not sure whether I am in the Projects directory. I need to change directory to the Projects directory. I know that it is in the home directory.
Action:
cmd cd ~/Projects
Observation:
lukasz@Smith:~$ cd ~/Projects
lukasz@Smith:~/Projects$
Thought:
I have changed the directory to the Projects directory. I can now create the folder for the project.
