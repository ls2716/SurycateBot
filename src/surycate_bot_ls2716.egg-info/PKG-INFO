# Surycate Bot Package

This is a surycate bot package which is used to create a text-based llm-powered automation bot within a linux terminal.


The package contains basic functionalities for the bot to be used within the script that runs automation.

## Installation

...


## Usage

To use the package, one needs to decide on the form of the iteration. Below is an example of context prompting iteration.

### Context Prompting Iteration


Context prompting iteration requires the user to provide an initial context to the task but more importantly memories based on which the bot will generate responses. The bot will then generate responses based on the context and memories provided.

Each memory is formed by a sequence of: context, thought, action, observation, thought and next context. For example, see a yaml version of a sample memory below:

```yaml
metadata:
  title: Got task to update linux and logged in.
  description: This is a memory of getting a task to update linux. This is after successful login.
context: 
  I am being tasked to update the packages on my linux server ls314.com.
  I have successfully sshed into the server. I can now update the packages.
action_thought: 
  I can update the packages on the server using the sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade commands.
action: 
  cmd sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
observation: |
  lukasz@ls314:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  [sudo] password for lukasz: 
thought: 
  I have been prompted for a password. I will have to enter it first.
new_context: 
  I am being tasked to update the packages on my linux server ls314.com.
  I have successfully sshed into the server and send the command to update the packages.
  I have been prompted for a password. I will have to enter it first.
```

The basic structure of the context prompting iteration is then as follows:

1. Initialize the bot with the context and memories.
2. Loop:
    1. Given the context, the bot fetches similar memories.
    2. Based on the memories and context, the bot generates an action thought.
    3. The bot then generates an action based on the thought.
    4. The bot observes the action.
    5. The bot generates a new thought based on the observation.
    6. The bot generates a new context based on observation and the thought.
